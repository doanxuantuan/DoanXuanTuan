// The code as it is currently written has several computational inefficiencies and anti-patterns. 

// 1. *Re-computation of sortedBalances on every render:* The sortedBalances variable is being recomputed on every render of the component, even though it only depends on balances and prices. This is inefficient and can lead to performance issues, especially if the balances array is large.

// 2. *Inefficient Filtering and Sorting:* The filtering and sorting operations are done in two separate steps. This leads to unnecessary iterations over the balances array. Also, the getPriority function is called multiple times for the same blockchain value during the sorting operation, which is unnecessary.

// 3. *Inefficient Mapping:* The formattedBalances and rows variables are both mapped from sortedBalances, leading to two separate iterations over the array. This is inefficient and can be combined into a single mapping operation.

// 4. *Use of Index as Key:* In the map function that creates rows, the index of the balance is used as a key. This is an anti-pattern in React, as it can lead to issues with component state and performance, especially if the list can change dynamically.

// Here is a refactored version of the code that addresses these issues:

const WalletPage: React.FC<Props> = (props: Props) => {
  const { children, ...rest } = props;
  const balances = useWalletBalances();
  const prices = usePrices();

  const getPriority = useCallback((blockchain: any): number => {
    switch (blockchain) {
      case 'Osmosis':
        return 100
      case 'Ethereum':
        return 50
      case 'Arbitrum':
        return 30
      case 'Zilliqa':
        return 20
      case 'Neo':
        return 20
      default:
        return -99
    }
  }, []);

  const rows = useMemo(() => {
    return balances
      .filter((balance: WalletBalance) => getPriority(balance.blockchain) > -99 && balance.amount > 0)
      .sort((lhs: WalletBalance, rhs: WalletBalance) => {
        return getPriority(rhs.blockchain) - getPriority(lhs.blockchain);
      })
      .map((balance: WalletBalance) => {
        const usdValue = prices[balance.currency] * balance.amount;
        return (
          <WalletRow 
            className={classes.row}
            key={balance.currency}
            amount={balance.amount}
            usdValue={usdValue}
            formattedAmount={balance.amount.toFixed()}
          />
        )
      });
  }, [balances, prices, getPriority]);

  return (
    <div {...rest}>
      {rows}
    </div>
  )
}

// In this version, getPriority is wrapped in a useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-creations of the function.
//  The useMemo hook is used to ensure that rows is only recomputed when balances or prices change. Filtering, sorting, 
//  and mapping are combined into a single chain of operations. Finally, the balance.currency is used as a 
//  key for the WalletRow components, assuming that the currency is unique for each balance.
